# CNN_multi_target_tracking  
Pytorch implementation of CNN to track multiple target  
This project is for learning,I just want to try to use CNN without any other technology.  
If you are looking for a commercial project，I suggest you look at MTCNN and YOLO.  
Here's the effect display：

The training data is too large to be uploaded.You can also use your own data set.  
If you want my data, you can contact me.  
You can also Optimize this algorithm.   
If you want to exchange ideas with me，you can add me to WeChat:zggcdbs.
